**FAQ**

**_What the key difference from Splitwise, Splid and others?_**

The main mission of Wesplit is to track expense as simple as possible.
You could share a link to your friends in messenger and they could add expenses even without knowing anything about the service.

**_What platform are supported?_**

I use Kotlin Multiplatform to support all platforms.
Web, Android, iOS, all form factors.
Desktop is still pending 'cause native data integration takes time.
